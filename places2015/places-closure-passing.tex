\begin{abstract}

Programming systems incorporating aspects of functional programming, e.g.,
higher-order functions, are becoming increasingly popular for large-scale
distributed programming. New frameworks such as Apache Spark leverage
functional techniques to provide high-level, declarative APIs for in-memory
data analytics, often outperforming traditional ``big data'' frameworks like
Hadoop MapReduce. However, widely-used programming models remain rather
ad-hoc; aspects such as implementation trade-offs, static typing, and semantics
are not yet well-understood. We present a new asynchronous programming model
that has at its core several principles facilitating functional processing of
distributed data. The emphasis of our model is on simplicity, performance,
expressiveness, and a well-defined operational semantics. The primary means of
communication is by passing functions (closures) to distributed, immutable
data. To ensure safe and efficient distribution of closures, our model
leverages both syntactic and type-based restrictions. We report on a prototype
implementation as an embedded domain-specific language in Scala. Finally, we
present first results practically evaluating our implementation.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Programming systems for large-scala data processing are increasingly embracing
functional programming, i.e., programming with first-class functions and
higher-order functions. Arguably, one of the first widely-used programming
models for ``big data'' processing making use of concepts from functional
programming is Google's MapReduce~\cite{DeanG08}. Indeed, \cite{Lammel08}
shows a precise executable semantics of MapReduce in Haskell. While leveraging
functional programming \emph{concepts}, popular implementations of the
MapReduce model, such as Hadoop MapReduce\footnote{See \url{http://hadoop.apache.org/}}
for Java, have been developed without making
use of functional \emph{language features} such as closures. In contrast, a new generation
of programming systems for large-scale data processing, such as
Apache Spark~\cite{Zaharia2012},
Twitter's Scalding\footnote{See \url{https://github.com/twitter/scalding/}},
and Scoobi\footnote{See \url{http://nicta.github.io/scoobi/}} build on functional
language features in order to provide high-level, declarative APIs.

However, many aspects of these programming systems remain ad-hoc and
out-of-scope for formal treatment. This paper presents a new asynchronous programming
model for functional processing of distributed data. One important goal of our
model is to better understand programming systems such as Spark, Scalding, and
Scoobi, by incorporating several of their core principles; namely, immutable
distributed data and distributed closure passing. By focussing on simplicity,
expressiveness, and performance (and ignoring many of the more ad-hoc
refinements of the mentioned programming models) our
programming model--together with its prototype implementation--enables exploring
implementation trade-offs, and capturing the semantics of the core constructs more
precisely. The primary means of communication is by passing functions (closures)
to distributed, immutable data.

To ensure safe and efficient distribution of closures, our model leverages
both syntactic and type-based restrictions. For instance, closures sent to
remote nodes are required to conform to the restrictions imposed by the
so-called ``Spore'' abstraction that the authors presented in previous
work~\cite{MillerHO14}. Among others, the syntax and static semantics of
Spores can guarantee the absence of runtime serialization errors due to
closure environments that are not serializable.

Here, we should copy-paste from pickling paper to provide the necessary background.
We also need to provide a basic summary of spores, see spores paper.
